# OMITIALIZER
This is a simple bash script that 'initializes' your clean Debian installation, carefully curating the binaries you might need

## How to use
You pretty much just run the bash script and everything is being taken care off
``` sh
    $ bash omitializer.sh 
```
### Notice
This is a bash script that is tailored for YABOI, if you want to add or remove something feel free to do so.
also for 1337 students, I am thinking of adding X11 and installing the MiniLibx library, but since I don't need it.... yeah.
