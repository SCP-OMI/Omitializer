# OMITIALIZER
This is a simple bash script that 'initializes' your clean Debian installation, carefully curating the binaries you might need

## How to use
You pretty much just run this and everything is being taken care off
```bs
    bash omitializer.sh 
```
### Notice
This is a bash script that is tailored for me, if you want to add something or remove it feel free to do so.
also for 1337 students, I am thinkng of add X11 and installing the MiniLibx library, but since i don't need it.... yeah.
